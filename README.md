# CSI 4142 - Assignment 2: Data Cleaning (Netflix Dataset) 

This project was completed as part of the **Fundamentals of Data Science (CSI 4142)** course at the University of Ottawa.  
It focuses on **data cleaning and preprocessing** of the **Netflix Movies & TV Shows dataset**.

---

## Dataset
**Netflix Movies and TV Shows**  
- Attributes: title, genre, director, cast, release year, duration, rating, etc.  
- Source: [Netflix Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows)  

---

## Tools & Libraries
- **Google Colab** (Jupyter Notebook environment)  
- Python  
- Pandas, NumPy  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  

---

## Workflow
1. Importation of the dataset (CSV).  
2. Data exploration: structure, missing values, distributions.  
3. Data cleaning:  
   - Handling missing values in cast, director, and rating.  
   - Fixing duplicates and inconsistent formats.  
   - Standardizing date/time formats.  
4. Dataset prepared for **further exploratory analysis & modeling**.  

---

## Key Insights
- Missing values were significant in the `director` and `cast` columns.  
- Duration and release year required cleaning for consistency.  
- Clean dataset is now structured for **trend analysis** (e.g., growth of Netflix TV shows vs movies, genre distribution).
